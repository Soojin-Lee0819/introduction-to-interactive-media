# Arduino Assignment 4: Flappy Bird Processing and Arduino

This week's assignment made use of the Piezo buzzer and the potentiometer that communicated to Processing to make a Flappy Bird game. When Processing starts to run, it plays the Mario Introduction melody. Then, the game begins and the bird uses the J key to make the bird float through the pipes, playing the Mario 1-Up sound when successful and gaining a point. When the bird hits the ground or the pipes, it triggers the game over.
