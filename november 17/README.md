This week's assignment makes use of a buzzer, servo motor, button, photoresistor, and potentiometer to create a "Christmas Radio" to commemorate the holiday season.

Mapping the potentiometer from 0 to 4, each number represents a new song, which will play if you hold down the button (1 for We Wish You A Merry Christmas,
2 for Santa Claus is Coming to Town, 3 for Jingle Bells). As the song plays, the servo motor--to which I added a clay Christmas tree on top--will spin accordingly.

To make use of the photoresistor as well, I made an easter egg so that, if all the numbers in the read.serial function is equal to zero
(so if the potentiometer is turned all the way down and if the photo resistor is covered), it will play the Philippine National Anthem if you press down on the button.
