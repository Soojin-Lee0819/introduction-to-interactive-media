# FINAL PROJECT

## November 21

Because I thought our last assignment was the final project, I started early. I first wanted to recreate Pacman, so I was able to find the [character sprites](https://www.spriters-resource.com/game_boy_advance/namcomuseum/sheet/22732/) for the game. Now having something to animate, I duplicated the 5 sprites to 15 to make the animation slower.


I also added the Pacman theme song to my Arduino, which can be seen in this [link](https://youtu.be/12gmkMfC8Mk).

**WILL I CHANGE MY PROJECT?** Because the process was relatively smooth, I do not want to change my project.

 I was able to make the animation move slow even without 15 sprites, so I reduced it to 5 again. After, I decided to create background of the maze, and make the pacman smaller to fit inside the maze. However, I realized that making the constraints for the maze will be too hard, and setting up random places for the ghosts to move will be too hard too.
 
 Then, I tried creating the Pacman eating sound, but it was too hard because there was no correct pitch on Arduino. This is seen below:
 
 
 
 **WILL I CHANGE MY PROJECT?** After this, I decided to change my project to Flappy Bird.
 
 I then began to look for the character sprites for Flappy Bird, which I was able to find in [Spriter's Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/mobile/flappybird/sheet/59537/). After finding it, I first began to animate the background to make it look like it's constantly moving.

After finally realizing that our assignment was not the final project, I rushed to finish what I had so far. I added many things, such as connecting Arduino to Processing, putting the score on the top left corner, and adding the starting and game over screens. A video of my friend playing it can be found [here](https://youtu.be/x8DGZu52Qyw).
