# Production Assignment 5: Processing Image Manipulation

## DESCRIPTION
For this midterm project, I decided to create a game inspired by the popular group game at the moment, [Among Us](http://www.innersloth.com/gameAmongUs.php). This has become my favorite game over these past few months for the cute characters. My game entails having to run up to spawning targets and killing them before the timer runs out.

## JOURNAL ENTRIES

### October 9
I was super interested in it after watching Professor give us a tutorial in class. After looking at the website we were given in class for character sprites, I found a character sprite of the default player. I'm also not sure how to change the colors of the character through getting the color of the pixel and changing it.

After tinkering around with a code and searching tutorials on YouTube, I was able to get it to work properly. It now walks whenever the player presses the arrow keys. What I don't know how to do is to make the character turn when it moves left, right now it looks like it's moonwalking.

### October 14
After finishing my October 13 assignment, I wanted to go back and work on this again, so I decided to add the killing animation early. It was a bit hard adding two character sprites, but I was able to do it. Just using a simple mousePressed function on any part of the screen, I tested the killing animation and got it to work properly on one target before multiplying them to respawn.

### October 16
I added a kill button, and made it so that the player clicks the button and not anywhere on the screen to kill the target. I also set restrictions so that the player has to be close to the target to kill it. I was able to make the target respawn, however I have some problems with letting the dying animation play all the way before respawning the character. I was also able to make the character look to the left when walking left using the transform function.

I was also able to add the background of the game by editing a photo of the actual game so there's no boxes around.

I also added a timer for the game to stop after 30 seconds, and a score function to count how many times the player kills their target.

**WILL I CHANGE MY PROJECT?** I made great progress on this project today, and I have not made a big decision to change my project since everything is going smoothly.
