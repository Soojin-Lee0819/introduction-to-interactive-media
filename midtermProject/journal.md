# Production Assignment 5: Processing Image Manipulation

For this week, I wanted to do an "image comparison slider" that showed a girl walking in the rain peacefully turning into a dark day after being struck with lightning and showing her entire skeleton. The final result (without sound) is below:

## DESCRIPTION
At first, I actually wanted to create an animated avatar walking with sounds. I was super interested in it after watching Professor give us a tutorial in class. After looking at the website we were given in class for character sprites, I found a character sprite of my favorite game recently, [Among Us](http://www.innersloth.com/gameAmongUs.php).

However, though I was able to get it to work fairly well, I decided to save it for our Midterm project game, as having a character there would be more suited. So, because of this, I decided to get a new idea.
